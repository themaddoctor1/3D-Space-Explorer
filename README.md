# 3D Space Explorer
3D Space Explorer is a project based off of the [Locus Game Engine](https://github.com/themaddoctor1/GameEngine_Locus) that I wrote.
I started writing this game as an excuse to play around with design patterns.
From what I can recall, it appears to be either the Oserver or Decorator pattern, or something similar, but it doesn't matter too much, since this was meant to be fun to work on.
